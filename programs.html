<h3 class="sectitle">bayesdtm: Bayesian Decision-Theoretic Models to Compute Expected Losses under an Intervention and the Status Quo</h3>
Current version: 1.0.0<br>
<a href="bayesdtm.html">Vignette</a>

<p>
The R package "bayesdtm" implements Bayesian decision-theoretic models to compute expected losses under an intervention (in causal inference senses) and those under no intervention (i.e., the status quo), across different ratios of the cost of the intervention to the cost of an undesirable outcome. For details on how to install and use the package, please see the <a href="bayesdtm.html">vignette</a>.
