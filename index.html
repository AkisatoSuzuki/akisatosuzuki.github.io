Welcome! This is my personal website. I am a social data scientist and interested in analyzing policy-relevant topics in (inter)national security and economy.
</p>

<p>
I am currently an Adjunct Research Fellow at the School of Politics and International Relations, University College Dublin. My previous academic positions include a Lectureship at the School of Law and Government, Dublin City University, an Irish Research Council Government of Ireland Postdoctoral Fellowship at the School of Politics and International Relations, University College Dublin, and a Max Weber Fellowship at the European University Institute, among others. I obtained my PhD from the School of Law and Government, Dublin City University, in 2015.
